# VOX 2.0

An upgraded version of my old TTS Interface batchfile. It's included in this project for comparison's sake. I hope to use this framework to read specially formatted textfiles to have TTS Voices act out a story, but that's a little further down the line. 


Included here is BasicRender 2.0, VBTyper, and the Speaker class, all of which are mine, and may be reused by anyone, as long as I can get a little credit.
